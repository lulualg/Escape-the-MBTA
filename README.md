### The Game

Explore the Ruggles train station and embark on a journey to find the hidden treasure, all under an interactive escape room setting!
This digital escape room was designed by Abbie Tyler, Luke Meininger, Lulwa Alghanim, and Zakiya Sheikh.
It is inspired by “dive the game” which is an underwater diving game we remixed on glitch.
We hope you have as much fun playing as we did designing the game!

This game consists of 21 rooms, which can be navigated through cardinal directions (NORTH, EAST, WEST, SOUTH).
As you progress throughout the game, you will find interactive objects that you may use to your benefit.
Each room contains hints to help you escape either the same room or another locked room.
The hints may also help guide you through the map, but you must lead the path by solving unique puzzles designed specifically for your current setting.
Once you have escaped, your next goal is to find the hidden treasure.
